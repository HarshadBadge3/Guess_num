// This is a simple C++ project where the user has to guess the number chosen by the computer.  
The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player keeps guessing until they get it right.

## Features
- Random number generation  
- Hints for higher or lower guesses  
- Counts number of attemptsğŸ’«....
